                        <span>Hello! I'm Alex, a software quality assurance specialist in Newburyport, MA who has
                        been working towards becoming a junior software developer. I develop automation scripts,
                        full-stack websites, and am always looking to learn more.</span>

                        <p>
                        <span>After high school I enlisted into the US Army, where I served for 4 years before
                            deciding to pursue an education full-time.</span></p>
                        <p>
                        <span>I attended the University of Massachusetts - Boston, graduating with highest honors.
                            Shortly after, I joined the Transparent Language QA team where I worked on manual and automated testing web applications and mysql and mongodb
                            databases.

                            Most recently, I have joined the Firebrand Technologies QA Team.</span>
